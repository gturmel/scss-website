                  <p>All flight trooper, man your stations. All flight troops, man your stations. So...you got your reward and you're just leaving then? That's right, yeah! I got some old debts I've got to pay off with this stuff. Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough to stick around here, do you? Why don't you come with us? You're pretty good in a fight. I could use you. Come on! Why don't you take a look around? You know what's about to happen, what they're up against. They could use a good pilot like you. You're turning your back on them.

                  <p>Just because I can drill you between the eyes at a hundred metres, doesn't mean I can't like sensitive stuff. I tried asking Liara questions about the asari mating process. She said I don't safeguard the secrets of the crew well enough to entrust me with such... private information. The asari word she used translates as 'blabbermouth.' Rachni extinction tragic. Didn't want to repeat. All life precious. Universe demands diversity. They said it couldn't be done! Then again, that's been said about a lot of things you do.
