# A few thoughts on Sass.

Hi Kelly and Jasmine,

I wanted to get a few questions down here so that I can get them out of my brain and to you two. First off: oh man, did I forget my first question already? I think I may have....
Secondly: Magic numbers? We haven't talked about these at all, and this guy is very anti-magic numbers, but I'm curious about them, so I can know what to avoid.
Thirdly: what is color saturation?
Fourthly: Lets talk about SassDoc, and what it is

An observation: he talked about how components should do one thing, and be used all over. I feel like Matt and I could have done this better with the Appointment App, using the same form for both the Edits page and the New appt page. Learning!

This layout section is awesome.
